# Shopify → Slack Connectivity API Demo

This project showcases how to use [Alloy's Connectivity API](https://docs.runalloy.com/reference/connectivity-api/) to *directly* execute connector actions without workflows. It reads high-value Shopify orders using the `listOrders` action and posts notifications to Slack using the `postMessage` action.

## Connectivity API Overview

The Connectivity API exposes every Alloy connector as REST resources so you can:

- Discover connectors, actions, and schemas from your backend.
- Programmatically create users and credentials (OAuth/API keys).
- Execute actions on behalf of a user by referencing connector IDs and credential IDs.

Each request is a standard HTTP call against `https://api.runalloy.com/2025-09/` with the following headers:

```
Authorization: Bearer <ALLOY_API_KEY>
x-api-version: 2025-09
Content-Type: application/json
```

Unlike the Embedded/Unified API, Connectivity gives you direct, low-level access to connector actions that you can orchestrate yourself.

## Authentication & Provisioning Flow

1. **Create a user** via `POST /users` to represent your merchant/tenant and store the returned `userId`.
2. **Create credentials** for that user via `POST /users/{userId}/credentials`:
   - For OAuth connectors (Shopify, Slack) redirect the merchant to the `oauthUrl` and capture the resulting `credentialId`.
   - For API key connectors, send the credentials payload directly and store the `credentialId`.
3. **Execute actions** by providing `userId`, `connectorId`, `actionId`, and `credentialId` to `POST /users/{userId}/executions`.

The `userId` + `credentialId` pair is all the code needs to invoke Shopify and Slack on behalf of the merchant.

## READ/WRITE Demo Flow

- **READ** – `listOrders` on the Shopify connector retrieves recent orders. Orders above the configured dollar threshold are considered high-value.
- **WRITE** – For each qualifying order, the app calls Slack's `postMessage` action to send a richly formatted Block Kit notification to the configured channel.

## Prerequisites & Setup

1. **Sign up at [runalloy.com](https://runalloy.com)** and create an API key from the dashboard.
2. **Install uv** (https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) and Python 3.11.
3. **Create a Connectivity API user** with `POST /users` and save the returned `userId`.
4. **Create a Shopify credential**
   - Call `POST /users/{userId}/credentials` with `connectorId=shopify`.
   - Redirect the merchant to the returned `oauthUrl` and capture the `credentialId` once authorization completes.
5. **Create a Slack credential** following the same OAuth pattern (`connectorId=slack`).
6. **Bootstrap credentials (optional helper script)** – if you prefer guided prompts, run:
   ```bash
   uv run python setup_credentials.py
   ```
   The script creates a user, shows connector metadata, walks through Shopify + Slack OAuth, and prints the credential IDs to add to `.env`.
7. **Copy `.env.example` to `.env`** and populate every setting:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # edit the file with your ALLOY_API_KEY, USER_ID, credential IDs, Slack channel, etc.
   ```
8. **Install dependencies** (handled automatically if you ran `uv init`, but you can re-sync at any time):
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

## Running the Integration

Run once (fetch + notify):

```bash
uv run python -m src.main
```

Run continuously with polling:

```bash
uv run python -m src.main --continuous
```

Environment variable overrides (e.g., `ORDER_VALUE_THRESHOLD`) can also be exported directly; Pydantic reads values from the environment before `.env`.

## Tests

`tests/test_integration.py` exercises the same READ and WRITE endpoints in a guided fashion:

1. Lists available connectors.
2. Lists credentials for your user.
3. Reads Shopify orders via `listOrders`.
4. Processes sample orders locally.
5. Formats a Slack message.
6. (Optional) posts a test message to Slack.

Run:

```bash
uv run python tests/test_integration.py
```

> ⚠️ The tests invoke live Connectivity API endpoints. Ensure `ALLOY_API_KEY`, `ALLOY_USER_ID`, and credential IDs are valid before running them.

## Example Payloads

- `examples/sample_shopify_response.json` – Realistic order response from Shopify's `listOrders` action.
- `examples/sample_slack_blocks.json` – Example Slack Block Kit payload generated by the formatter.

## Emphasis on Connectivity API Usage

- All HTTP calls are made directly with `requests` against `/users`, `/connectors`, and `/executions` endpoints.
- No SDKs or workflow automation features are used; the demo shows how to orchestrate actions yourself.
- The code keeps connector IDs (`shopify`, `slack`) and credential IDs configurable so you can swap environments or tenants easily.
